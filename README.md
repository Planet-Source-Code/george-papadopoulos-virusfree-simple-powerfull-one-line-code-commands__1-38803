<p>1) Let's say we have a file <font color="#FF0000">C:\TEST.EXE</font> and
we want to rename it to <font color="#FF0000">C:\MYCGI.CGI</font>
.
<p>We can
do that with this simple command
<p><font color="#0000FF">Name &quot;C:\TEST.EXE&quot;
as &quot;C:\MYCGI.CGI&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">2) If we want to move the above file ( </font><font color="#FF0000"> C:\TEST.EXE
 </font><font color="#000000">
) to the folder </font><font color="#FF0000"> C:\THEFOLDER\&nbsp;
</font>
<p><font color="#000000"> we can do that by
changing the above command to :</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Name &quot;C:\TEST.EXE&quot;
as &quot;C:\THEFOLDER\TEST.EXE&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">3) Let's say we have a folder <font color="#FF0000">C:\TEST\</font>
and we want to rename it to&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000"> <font color="#FF0000">C:\RENAMED\</font>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Name &quot;C:\TEST\&quot; as &quot;C:\RENAMED\&quot;</font>
<p>or
<p><font color="#0000FF">Name &quot;C:\TEST&quot;
as &quot;C:\RENAMED&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">4) If we want to disappear our program from the endtask
list we can do it using the following command</font>
<p><font color="#0000FF">App.TaskVisible = False </font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">That's it.I hope you found this article interesting!</font>
